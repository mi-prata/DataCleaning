#Introduction

This is the codebook for the data set created for this assignement. The data set is called `tidy`.

#Data dictionary

**SubjectNumber**   -- Test subject number. Varies from 1 to 30.

**Activity** -- Activity being performed while measurements were made. Can be:

* Lying
* Sitting
* Standing
* Walking
* Walking Downstairs
* Walking Upstairs

The other columns contain all the variable means and standard deviations. Their names are the same as the ones in the **features.txt** (see README.Rmd). However, in order to use the `select` function in R, invalid character names were removed with `make.name`, so for example, the variable,

**tBodyAcc-mean()-X** becomes **tBodyAcc.mean...X**
